Spectral filter array (SFA) cameras provide a cost-effective, single-shot solution for capturing spectral images across multiple bands, offering valuable insights beyond traditional colour imaging. However, the sparse spatial sampling rate and strong spectral cross-correlation make SFA image demosaicking a challenging task. Additionally, due to hardware constraints, SFA cameras often exhibit lower spatial resolution compared to standard colour cameras. In this paper we introduce an end-to-end solution for simultaneous demosaicking and super-resolution using multiple frames, leveraging a novel deep convolutional neural network. Moreover, we compare our joint framework with sequential state-of-the-art models. Through extensive experimentation on large synthetic spectral video datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art in both quantitative metrics and visual quality. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a real SFA camera, the CMS-C from Silios Technologies.
